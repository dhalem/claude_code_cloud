## 🚨 Critical Rules - Start Here

### The Four Fundamental Truths
1. **I WILL MAKE MISTAKES** - I must verify everything, always
2. **MOCK TESTING ≠ WORKING FEATURE** - Real integration testing is mandatory  
3. **ASSUMPTIONS KILL PROJECTS** - Always check current state before changes
4. **PROTOCOL-FIRST SAVES HOURS** - Analyze API patterns before building UI

### Pre-Action Checklist (NEVER SKIP)
```bash
# Run this EVERY TIME before ANY work:
pwd                                                    # 0. VERIFY DIRECTORY FIRST
git status && git log --oneline -3                    # 1. Current state
docker -c musicbot ps                                  # 2. Container status
./run_tests.sh basic                                   # 3. Baseline validation
```

### The Honesty Protocol
**NEVER CLAIM WORK IS COMPLETE WITHOUT:**
1. Running the actual command that executes it
2. Seeing real output (not simulated)
3. Verifying all dependencies exist (Dockerfiles, configs, etc.)
4. Testing the "single command" promise actually works

**If something doesn't work:** Say "I created X but haven't verified it runs yet"

### Directory Awareness Protocol (MANDATORY)
**ALWAYS run `pwd` before ANY command that could be location-dependent**

**Project Structure Reference:**
- **Root**: `spotidal/` (for `./run_tests.sh`, `./curl_wrapper.sh`, docker commands)
- **Sonos**: `cd sonos_server` 
- **AI Backend**: `cd gemini_playlist_suggester`
- **React App**: `cd gemini_playlist_suggester/react-app` (for `./run-react-tests.sh`)
- **Workers**: `cd syncer`
- **Syncer v2**: `cd syncer_v2` (for Dagster-based migration)
- **Monitoring**: `cd monitoring`
- **Browser Testing**: `cd docker/browser-testing`

**Standard Pattern:**
1. Run `pwd` to verify current location
2. If wrong directory, `cd` to correct location
3. Execute intended command
4. No guessing, no assumptions about directory

### VPN Network Configuration (CRITICAL RULE)
**ONLY TWO SERVICES USE VPN - NO EXCEPTIONS**

**Services with VPN:**
1. **download_worker** - Downloads tracks from Tidal
2. **tidal_worker** - Matches Spotify tracks to Tidal

**ALL OTHER SERVICES MUST NOT HAVE VPN**

See `docs/infrastructure/CRITICAL-VPN-CONFIGURATION.md` for details. Never add VPN to any other service without explicit user approval.

### The Golden Testing Rule
**NO FEATURE IS COMPLETE UNTIL:**
1. ✅ API endpoints verified with `./curl_wrapper.sh`
2. ✅ Real service integration tested (not mocks)
3. ✅ End-to-end user workflow validated
4. ✅ Error scenarios tested and handled
5. ✅ Validation scripts created and passing
6. ✅ **ACTUALLY RUNS** - `docker compose up` or equivalent must work
7. ✅ **NO LYING** - Never claim work is done without verifying execution

### 🚫 ABSOLUTE MOCK PROHIBITION (CRITICAL FAILURE PREVENTION)
**MOCKS AND SIMULATIONS ARE STRICTLY FORBIDDEN**

This rule exists because the user experienced production failures from tests that passed with mocks but failed with real systems.

**FORBIDDEN PATTERNS (NEVER USE):**
```python
# ❌ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN
@mock.patch('any.service')
logger.warning("SIMULATION: ...")
if test_mode: return fake_result
client_id = 'test_client_id'
USE_MOCK_APIS = True
```

**MANDATORY PERMISSION PROTOCOL:**
If you need to add ANY mock, simulation, or test mode:
1. **STOP immediately** - Do not write any mock code
2. **Ask user permission** with detailed justification
3. **Explain why real testing is impossible** (infrastructure limitations, etc.)
4. **Get explicit written approval** before proceeding
5. **Document the temporary nature** and removal plan

**INTEGRATION TEST FILES WITH STRICT ENFORCEMENT:**
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/main.py`
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/test_orchestrator.py`
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/component_tests/*.py`
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/docker-compose.test.yml`
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/run_integration_tests.sh`

**WHY THIS RULE EXISTS:**
- Mocks provide false confidence about system integration
- Production failures occur when mocked dependencies behave differently than real ones
- User explicitly forbid mocks after experiencing real-world failures
- Real integration testing catches issues that mocks hide

**REQUIRED ALTERNATIVES:**
- Use real API credentials (from production database)
- Use real containers with real services
- Use real database connections
- Fail fast if real resources unavailable

## ⚡ Battle-Tested Patterns

*These patterns have been proven to save 50-70% development time and prevent costly mistakes*

### 1. Protocol-First Development (SAVES 2+ HOURS PER PHASE)

**The Pattern**: Always analyze existing API patterns before building new UI
```bash
# MANDATORY SEQUENCE:
1. Find original implementation (templates/index.html, existing fetch calls)
2. Document EXACT endpoints, parameters, response format
3. Test ALL endpoints with curl before React work: ./curl_wrapper.sh
4. Create protocol doc: docs/original-app-api-protocol-[feature].md
5. Only then implement React components
```

**Why It Works**: Eliminates 3-5 debugging cycles per integration

**Example Discovery Pattern** (adapt to your project's patterns):
```javascript
// Step 1: Find existing implementation patterns
// (Could be templates/, existing components, API docs, etc.)
fetch('/api/endpoint/', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        param_name: 'actual_value',      // Not assumed names
        setting_type: 'correct_format',  // Not guessed format
        context_data: userInput          // Use established patterns
    })
})

// Step 2: Test with curl/HTTP client before implementing
./curl_wrapper.sh -X POST http://server:port/api/endpoint/ \
  -d '{"param_name":"value","setting_type":"format","context_data":"test"}'

// Step 3: Implement with verified working parameters
```

### 2. Container-State-First Debugging

**The Pattern**: Always verify container contents before assuming local files work
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Local files ≠ container files
ls grafana/dashboards/*.json && echo "Working"

# ✅ RIGHT - Verify container state first
docker -c musicbot exec grafana ls /etc/grafana/dashboards/
docker -c musicbot compose build grafana  # Rebuild after file changes
docker -c musicbot exec grafana ls /etc/grafana/dashboards/  # Verify again
```

**Why It Works**: Prevents 2-3 hours debugging "missing" files that exist locally

### 3. Progressive Validation Strategy  

**The Pattern**: Test each layer before proceeding to the next
```bash
# Layer 1: API (Infrastructure) - catch config issues early
./curl_wrapper.sh http://musicbot:8002/api/endpoint

# Layer 2: Screenshots (Visual) - verify UI appears
./safe_screenshot.sh "http://musicbot:3011" "check.png" "Description"

# Layer 3: Interactive (Behavioral) - test user workflows  
node interactive_test.js

# Layer 4: Device State (Integration) - test with real hardware
./test_sonos_integration.js
```

**Why It Works**: Issues caught early cost minutes, issues caught late cost hours

### 4. Mock-Trap Prevention

**The Critical Insight**: Mocks prove code compiles, not that features work
```python
# ❌ DANGEROUS - False confidence
@mock.patch('mysql.connector.connect')
def test_database(mock_db):
    result = get_data()
    assert mock_db.called  # Proves nothing about real connectivity!

# ✅ ESSENTIAL - Real integration test
def test_database_real():
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(host='musicbot', database='spotidal')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM spotify_albums")
    assert cursor.fetchone()[0] > 0  # Proves real data exists
```

**Application**: Always pair mocked unit tests with real integration tests

### 5. Zero-Setup Containerized Testing

**The Pattern**: Every test runs in container with single command
```bash
# Perfect developer experience - works anywhere
git clone repo
cd spotidal/gemini_playlist_suggester/react-app
./run-react-tests.sh all  # Everything containerized, zero local setup
```

**Benefits Measured**:
- ✅ No environment inconsistencies
- ✅ New developer productive in 1 day vs 1 week
- ✅ CI/CD identical to local testing

### 6. Syncer Migration Validation Strategy (PREVENTS PRODUCTION FAILURES)

**The Pattern**: Complete integration testing framework with production data comparison
```bash
# CRITICAL LESSON: Never trust framework-level testing alone
cd syncer_v2/integration_tests
./run_integration_tests.sh --playlists 25  # Compare v2 vs legacy system

# What this SHOULD do (when real credentials provided):
1. Clone credentials from production database: scripts/init_test_db.sh
2. Run same 25 playlists through both legacy and v2 systems
3. Compare database records, downloaded files, and Plex integration
4. Generate evidence report showing identical behavior
```

**Why It Works**: Prevents catastrophic production failures from assumptions

**CRITICAL STATUS** (June 2025):
- ✅ **Framework Complete**: All integration tests exist and execute successfully
- ❌ **Real Validation Missing**: Tests run in SIMULATION mode due to missing credentials
- ❌ **Production Comparison**: No evidence that v2 produces same results as legacy
- 🚨 **Risk**: Framework completion ≠ production readiness

**Essential Files**:
- `docs/testing/syncer-v2-complete-integration-test-design.md` - Complete test strategy
- `docs/testing/syncer-v2-tdd-migration-plan.md` - 10-phase TDD implementation 
- `syncer_v2/REAL_INTEGRATION_TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md` - Current status and requirements
- `syncer_v2/integration_tests/scripts/init_test_db.sh` - Credential extraction from production

**User Instructions**: 
> "the spotify and tidal credentials should be cloned from the prod database, the docs should reflect this"

## Project Overview

**Spotidal**: Production-ready music streaming server with comprehensive monitoring
- **Core**: AirSonic/Sonos SMAPI compatibility serving 100,000+ tracks
- **Features**: Spotify/Tidal sync, AI-powered playlists, iOS app, React web UI
- **Scale**: 1,145+ test files, 15 Grafana dashboards, 7 active workers
- **Architecture**: Multi-component monorepo with microservices approach

### System Components
1. **Sonos SMAPI Server** (Port 8001): FastAPI/SOAP for Sonos integration
2. **AI Suggester Backend** (Port 8002): Multi-LLM playlist generation (Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral)
3. **React Web App** (Port 3011): Modern TypeScript UI - **RUNS IN SEPARATE CONTAINER** 
   - Container: `gemini-suggester-react` 
   - Location: `gemini_playlist_suggester/react-app/`
   - **NO VOLUME MOUNTS**: Remote Docker contexts (ssh://musicbot) don't support volume mounts
   - **REBUILD REQUIRED**: Changes require `docker -c musicbot compose build react-app && docker -c musicbot compose up -d react-app`
4. **iOS App**: SpotidalTestApp (React Native 0.76.1, Build 55)
5. **Worker Services** (Ports 9010-9016): 7 specialized workers for data pipeline
6. **Syncer v2** (Dagster Framework): Next-generation data pipeline orchestration
   - Location: `syncer_v2/`
   - Status: **IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE** - Ready for production deployment
   - **Migration Status**: All 10 TDD phases completed with 134+ tests passing
   - **Integration Test Suite**: `syncer_v2/integration_tests/` - Complete framework with real Spotify/Tidal/MySQL integration
   - **CRITICAL TESTING RULE**: **ALWAYS USE CONTAINERIZED ENVIRONMENT** - `cd syncer_v2/integration_tests && ./run_integration_tests.sh`
   - **Key Documentation**:
     - **Complete Integration Test Design**: `docs/testing/syncer-v2-complete-integration-test-design.md`
     - **TDD Migration Plan**: `docs/testing/syncer-v2-tdd-migration-plan.md`
     - **Integration Test Requirements**: `syncer_v2/REAL_INTEGRATION_TEST_REQUIREMENTS.md`
   - **Current Issue**: Integration tests exist but run in SIMULATION mode - need real credentials from production database
   - **Critical Note**: Framework is complete but NOT validated with real production data comparison
7. **Monitoring Stack**: Prometheus (9090), Grafana (3000), Alertmanager (9093), MySQL Exporter (9104)
8. **Browser Testing**: Browserless Chrome (3010) for automated UI testing

### Critical Context
- **Server**: Everything runs on `musicbot` (not local)
- **Docker**: Always use `-c musicbot` flag (never `docker context use`)
- **React App**: Separate container with volume mounts for hot reloading
- **Database**: MySQL with 135,424+ synced albums, optimized with covering indexes
- **Wrapper Scripts**: Use `./curl_wrapper.sh` and `./monitoring_query.sh`

## 🛡️ Mistake Prevention Checklist

## 📜 Testing Commandments

### 1. Thou Shalt Not Trust Mocks Alone (CRITICAL FAILURE MODE)
```python
# ❌ WRONG - This passes but proves nothing
@mock.patch('mysql.connector.connect')
def test_database(mock_db):
    assert mock_db.called  # Meaningless!

# ✅ RIGHT - Test real connectivity
def test_database():
    conn = mysql.connector.connect(host='musicbot', ...)
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    cursor.execute("SELECT 1")
```

**Real Examples That Cost Hours**:
- Grafana dashboards "tested" but files didn't exist in container
- React components passed unit tests but couldn't load real API data
- Database connections mocked but used wrong hostnames

### 2. Thou Shalt Verify Container Contents
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Files exist locally ≠ files in container
ls grafana/dashboards/*.json  # Local files

# ✅ RIGHT - Check inside container
docker -c musicbot exec grafana ls /etc/grafana/dashboards/
```

### 3. Thou Shalt Test APIs Before UI (PROTOCOL-FIRST)
```bash
# MANDATORY ORDER:
1. Analyze original app's fetch() patterns
2. Test API: ./curl_wrapper.sh http://musicbot:8002/api/endpoint
3. Document protocol: docs/api-protocol-[feature].md  
4. Verify response structure and data
5. Only then implement UI components
```

### 4. Thou Shalt Understand React Container Architecture
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Assuming React runs in main container
docker -c musicbot exec spotidal_suggester ls src/  # Wrong container!

# ✅ RIGHT - React runs in separate container WITHOUT volume mounts
docker -c musicbot ps | grep react  # Find: gemini-suggester-react
# React App: Port 3011, separate container, NO volume mounts
# Location: gemini_playlist_suggester/react-app/
# Changes require rebuild: docker -c musicbot compose build react-app
# Then restart: docker -c musicbot compose up -d react-app
```

### 5. Thou Shalt Validate Images Before Reading
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Crashes Claude Code
<use Read tool on untested.png>

# ✅ RIGHT - Always validate first
file screenshot.png | grep -q "PNG image data" || echo "Invalid image!"
```

### 6. Thou Shalt Use Existing Patterns
```python
# ❌ WRONG - Inventing new patterns
DB_HOST = "server.example.com"  # Hardcoded

# ✅ RIGHT - Follow established patterns
DB_HOST = os.getenv('ENV_DB_HOST', 'musicbot')  # Like other services
```

### 7. Thou Shalt Check Original App When Implementing New Features
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Guessing how functionality should work
# Implementing OAuth flow without checking existing implementation

# ✅ RIGHT - Reference original app for patterns
# 1. Locate original implementation in templates/index.html
# 2. Understand existing API endpoints and URL patterns  
# 3. Copy working patterns and adapt for new framework
# 4. Test against same endpoints as original
```

### 8. Thou Shalt Not Disturb Users When Testing Live Speakers
```bash
# 🔇 VOLUME TESTING RULES:
# Only test volume when speaker is PAUSED
if speaker_state == "PAUSED":
    test_volume_controls()  # Safe to adjust volume
    
# 🔇 PLAYBACK TESTING RULES:
# Only test play/pause when volume is ZERO
if speaker_volume == 0:
    test_playback_controls()  # Safe to play/pause

# ✅ CORRECT ORDER FOR LIVE TESTING:
1. Set volume to 0
2. Test play/pause functionality
3. Pause the speaker
4. Test volume controls
5. Restore original settings
```
**Why**: Respect for users near the speakers is paramount. Unexpected loud music or volume changes disrupt work/life.

### 9. Thou Shalt Always Use Containerized Environment for Syncer Testing
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Running tests locally or with partial dependencies
cd syncer_v2
python run_integration_tests.py  # Missing container isolation!

# ✅ RIGHT - Always use the containerized test environment
cd syncer_v2/integration_tests
./run_integration_tests.sh --playlists 25  # Full container orchestration

# Why containerized testing is MANDATORY:
1. Ensures identical environment to production
2. Isolates test databases from production
3. Manages all service dependencies automatically
4. Provides reproducible results across environments
```
**Why**: Syncer testing involves complex dependencies (MySQL, Spotify API, Tidal API, Plex, file systems). Only containerized testing guarantees consistent, isolated, production-like validation.

### 10. Thou Shalt Ask Permission Before Adding ANY Mock (MANDATORY PROTOCOL)
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Adding mocks without permission
@mock.patch('spotipy.Spotify')
def test_spotify():
    # This could hide real integration issues!

# ✅ RIGHT - Ask permission first
# 1. STOP immediately when considering a mock
# 2. Ask user: "I need to mock X because Y, is this acceptable?"
# 3. Explain why real testing isn't possible
# 4. Get explicit written approval
# 5. Document the temporary nature and removal plan

# MANDATORY PERMISSION PROTOCOL:
1. Identify the real service/resource needed
2. Explain infrastructure limitations preventing real testing
3. Request explicit user permission
4. Document why mock is temporary
5. Plan for real integration when infrastructure allows
```
**Why**: Mocks hide real integration failures that cause production outages. User experienced production failures from passing tests that used mocks but failed with real systems. All mocks require explicit permission to prevent false confidence.

## 🚫 Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### 1. The Mock-Only Testing Trap (MOST CRITICAL FAILURE MODE)
**Pitfall**: Building features that pass all unit tests but fail in real integration
**Impact**: 3+ hours debugging "working" features that don't actually work
**Prevention**: Always pair mocked tests with real integration tests
```bash
# Prevention checklist:
- [ ] Real API call tested with curl
- [ ] Real database connection verified
- [ ] Real container contents checked
- [ ] Real service integration confirmed
```

### 0. The "Implementation Complete" Lie (ABSOLUTE WORST FAILURE MODE)
**Pitfall**: Claiming work is done without running it
**Impact**: Loss of trust, wasted time, broken systems
**Prevention**: ALWAYS run before claiming completion
```bash
# MANDATORY before saying "complete" or "implemented":
- [ ] Docker build successful
- [ ] Docker run successful  
- [ ] Core functionality tested
- [ ] Output/logs verified
```
**Example**: "I implemented integration tests" → Must show `./run_integration_tests.sh` actually runs

### 2. Container Build State Assumptions (INFRASTRUCTURE TRAP)  
**Pitfall**: Assuming local files exist in containers
**Impact**: 2+ hours debugging "missing" files that exist locally
**Prevention**: Always verify container contents with `docker exec`
```bash
# ALWAYS after adding files:
docker -c musicbot compose build service
docker -c musicbot exec service ls /expected/path
```

### 3. Protocol Assumption Mistakes (API INTEGRATION TRAP)
**Pitfall**: Guessing API parameters instead of analyzing existing patterns
**Impact**: 2+ hours per integration debugging wrong parameters
**Prevention**: Always analyze original app's fetch() calls first
```bash
# MANDATORY for any API integration:
1. Search existing code for API patterns: grep -r "fetch\|request\|api" src/
2. Document exact parameters and response format
3. Test with HTTP client (curl/Postman/etc.) before implementing UI
```

### 4. Docker Context Confusion
**Pitfall**: Working on local Docker instead of musicbot
```bash
# ❌ WRONG
docker ps  # Shows local containers

# ✅ RIGHT
docker -c musicbot ps  # Shows musicbot containers
```

### 5. Container Rebuild After Code Changes (CRITICAL)
**Pitfall**: Forgetting to rebuild containers after code changes
**Impact**: Hours debugging "fixed" issues that are still broken in containers
**Prevention**: ALWAYS rebuild containers after ANY code change
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Edit code and run tests immediately
vim report_generator.py
./run_integration_tests.sh  # Still using old code!

# ✅ RIGHT - Edit, rebuild, then test
vim report_generator.py
docker -c musicbot compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build service-name
./run_integration_tests.sh  # Now using updated code

# For integration tests specifically:
docker -c musicbot compose -f docker-compose.test.yml build integration-test-controller
```
**Why**: Code runs INSIDE containers. Local changes don't affect running containers until rebuilt!

### 6. Screenshot Validation Failures
**Pitfall**: Invalid image files crash Read tool
```bash
# ✅ PREVENTION
./safe_screenshot.sh "http://musicbot:3011" "out.png" "Description"
file out.png  # Validate BEFORE reading
```

### 7. Volume Control Snap-Back
**Pitfall**: setTimeout() overwrites user changes
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG
setTimeout(() => loadSonosGroups(), 1000);  // Overwrites!

// ✅ RIGHT
updateLocalState(value);  // No automatic refresh
```

### 8. Prometheus Metric Conflicts
**Pitfall**: Duplicate metric registration crashes workers
```python
# ✅ SOLUTION - Use get_or_create pattern
def get_or_create_metric(metric_class, name, description, labels=None):
    try:
        return metric_class(name, description, labels or [])
    except ValueError:
        return REGISTRY._names_to_collectors[name]
```

### 9. Database Update Inconsistency
**Pitfall**: Updating only one table causes data drift
```python
# ✅ RIGHT - Update both tables in transaction
with db.transaction():
    cursor.execute("UPDATE spotify_albums SET downloaded = 1 WHERE id = %s", (id,))
    cursor.execute("UPDATE tidal_albums SET downloaded = 1 WHERE spotify_id = %s", (id,))
```

### 10. React Container Volume Mount Assumption
**Pitfall**: Assuming React container uses volume mounts for hot reloading
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - No volume mounts with remote Docker contexts
"Changes will hot reload automatically"  # FALSE!

# ✅ RIGHT - Must rebuild and restart container
cd gemini_playlist_suggester/react-app
docker -c musicbot compose build react-app
docker -c musicbot compose up -d react-app
```
**Impact**: Wasted time wondering why changes don't appear
**Prevention**: Always rebuild React container after code changes

### 11. VPN Network Misconfiguration
**Pitfall**: Adding VPN to services that don't need it
**Impact**: Performance degradation, connectivity issues, wasted resources
**Prevention**: ONLY download_worker and tidal_worker should have VPN
```yaml
# ❌ WRONG - Spotify doesn't need VPN
spotify_worker:
  networks:
    - vpn_network  # NO!
    
# ✅ RIGHT - Only Tidal services need VPN
tidal_worker:
  networks:
    - vpn_network  # YES - talks to Tidal API
    - metrics_network
```

## 🔄 Development Workflow

### Protocol-First Feature Implementation
```bash
1. Analyze existing patterns: grep -r "fetch\|request\|api" src/
2. Document API protocol: docs/api-protocol-[feature].md  
3. Test real API: ./test_wrapper.sh http://server:port/endpoint
4. Write tests FIRST
5. Implement feature
6. Run tests: ./run_tests.sh
7. Test with real services
8. Update documentation
9. Commit with descriptive message
```

### Progressive Debugging Workflow
```bash
1. Layer 1 - API: ./curl_wrapper.sh http://musicbot:8002/api/endpoint
2. Layer 2 - Logs: docker -c musicbot compose logs service
3. Layer 3 - Metrics: ./monitoring_query.sh
4. Layer 4 - Container State: docker exec service ls /path
5. Layer 5 - Database: Check database state
6. Layer 6 - Git History: git log --oneline -10
```

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

### Worker Crash Loop
```bash
# 1. Check for metric conflicts
docker -c musicbot compose logs worker_name | grep "Duplicated timeseries"

# 2. Fix with get_or_create_metric pattern
# 3. Rebuild: docker -c musicbot compose build
# 4. Redeploy: docker -c musicbot compose up -d
```

### Database Inconsistency
```bash
# 1. Check data drift
python3 check_data_consistency.py

# 2. Run sync script if needed
python3 sync_dual_tables.py

# 3. Monitor for recurrence
```

### UI Not Updating
```bash
# 1. Test backend API first
./curl_wrapper.sh http://musicbot:8002/api/endpoint

# 2. Check browser console for errors
# 3. Verify proxy configuration in vite.config.ts
# 4. Check for setTimeout interference
```

### React App Issues
```bash
# 1. Verify container is running
docker -c musicbot ps | grep react

# 2. Check container logs
docker -c musicbot compose logs gemini-suggester-react

# 3. Test API connectivity from React container
docker -c musicbot exec gemini-suggester-react curl http://172.28.0.1:8002/health

# 4. Rebuild if needed
docker -c musicbot compose build gemini-suggester-react
```

## 📋 Documentation Standards

### All Docs MUST Include
1. **Creation Context** section with original prompt (for AI-generated docs)
2. **Table of Contents** with anchor links (for docs > 3 sections)
3. **Progress Tracking** sections (**MANDATORY for ALL docs**)
4. **Document Changelog** with dates and versions

### Creation Context Requirements
**For all AI-generated documentation**, include a "Creation Context" section at the top with:
- **Original Prompt**: The exact human request that initiated the document creation
- **Date Created**: When the document was generated
- **Author**: Who/what created it (e.g., "Claude Code Assistant")
- **Status**: Current phase (e.g., "Design Phase", "Implementation", "Complete")

This provides crucial context for future reference and helps understand the document's purpose and scope.

### Anchor Link Verification Rules
**CRITICAL**: Always verify anchor links work correctly!

1. **Generate anchors correctly**:
   - Lowercase all text
   - Replace spaces with hyphens
   - Remove special characters except hyphens
   - Keep emojis in anchors (they become part of the ID)
   - Example: `## 🚨 Critical Rules` → `#-critical-rules`

2. **Test all links**:
   ```bash
   # After creating/updating a document:
   # 1. Click each TOC link in GitHub preview
   # 2. Verify it jumps to correct section
   # 3. Fix any broken links before committing
   ```

3. **Common pitfalls**:
   - Emojis in headers require the emoji in the anchor
   - Multiple hyphens collapse to single hyphen
   - Case sensitivity matters (always use lowercase)

### Documentation Location Rules
- **ALL docs go in `docs/` directory**
- **Use established subdirectory structure**
- **Update `docs/README.md` index when adding files**
- **Follow kebab-case naming convention**

### Progress Tracking Template
```markdown
## 📝 Progress Tracking & Updates

**IMPORTANT**: This document should be updated throughout implementation with:
- Progress status after each phase
- Actual results vs. expected outcomes
- Lessons learned and unexpected findings
- Code changes made and their effectiveness
- Metrics before/after each change
- Any deviations from the original plan

*Update this section after each significant milestone.*

### Phase X Progress
**Started**: [Date, Time]
**Completed**: [Date, Time]
**Results**: [What actually happened vs expected]
**Lessons Learned**: [Key discoveries]
**Metrics**: [Before/after measurements]
```

## 📝 Document Review Process

### Pull Request-Based Review Workflow
When you request "create a doc for my review" or similar phrases, I will:

1. **Write** the document in the appropriate `docs/` subdirectory  
2. **Use the PR script**: `./scripts/create-review-pr.sh` for reliable automation
3. **Provide** the GitHub PR link for your review
4. **Wait** for your feedback via PR comments
5. **Address each comment** by:
   - Making the requested changes in the code
   - Replying to the comment confirming the change was made
   - Resolving the comment thread
6. **Push updates** to the PR branch
7. **Merge** the PR only when you explicitly approve

### Automated PR Creation Script
**MANDATORY**: Use `./scripts/create-review-pr.sh` for all document review PRs:

```bash
# Usage
./scripts/create-review-pr.sh "branch-name" "PR title" "file-path" "description"

# Example  
./scripts/create-review-pr.sh "docs/my-feature" "Add new feature docs" "docs/feature.md" "Comprehensive documentation for new feature"
```

**Script Features:**
- **Reliable Pushes**: Auto-configures git for large repositories
- **Error Handling**: Retry logic and cleanup on failures  
- **Prerequisites**: Validates gh CLI and git repository
- **Colored Output**: Clear status indicators

### Example Phrases That Trigger This Process
- "Create a doc for my review"
- "Write up a plan and let me review"
- "Document this for my approval"
- "Create a design doc and send me the link"

### The PR Review Cycle
```bash
Claude creates branch → writes doc → commits → pushes → creates PR → 
PR link provided → your PR comments → Claude updates branch → 
pushes updates → repeat until you approve and request merge
```

### Benefits of PR-Based Review
- **Version Control**: Full history of review iterations
- **Structured Feedback**: Line-by-line comments on specific sections
- **Clear Approval**: Explicit merge request when ready
- **GitHub Integration**: Leverages native review tools
- **No URL Changes**: Stable PR link throughout review process

### Commands Used
```bash
# Create and switch to feature branch
git checkout -b docs/feature-description

# Create PR with structured body
gh pr create --title "docs: [Description]" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
## Summary
[Brief description of documentation]

## Changes Made
- [List of key changes]

## Review Notes
[Any specific areas to focus on]

🤖 Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code)

)"
```

### Handling PR Review Comments
**CRITICAL**: When addressing review feedback:

1. **For each comment**:
   - Make the requested change
   - Reply to the comment: "✅ Done - [brief description of change]" 
   - Resolve the comment thread using GitHub UI
   
2. **Track progress**:
   - Use `gh pr view <number> --comments` to see all comments
   - Address ALL comments before claiming ready for re-review
   - Missing comments = incomplete work
   
3. **Best practices**:
   - Reply AS you fix (not in batch later)
   - Be specific about what was changed
   - If you disagree, discuss before proceeding
   - NEVER ignore comments

**This eliminates confusion and provides a professional review experience with full GitHub integration.**

### Comprehensive Review Process Requirements

**CRITICAL**: When making document updates, especially after multiple rounds of feedback, always apply comprehensive review methodology:

1. **Consider Complete Context**:
   - Review the **entire revision history** of the document
   - Analyze **all PR comments** and feedback patterns
   - Reference the **original prompt** that initiated the document creation
   - Understand the **evolution of requirements** through feedback cycles

2. **Feedback Pattern Analysis**:
   - Identify recurring themes across multiple feedback rounds
   - Note contradictory feedback and find balanced solutions
   - Track user preference changes over time
   - Document design trade-offs made based on feedback

3. **Integration Requirements**:
   - Address **all outstanding feedback** in a single comprehensive update
   - Explain how conflicting feedback was resolved
   - Reference specific feedback quotes in changelog entries
   - Maintain design coherence while incorporating all valid points

**Example Application**:
```
User feedback pattern: "too complex" → "too simple" → "too implementation-focused"
Solution: Balanced design with clear component boundaries but implementation in appendix
Rationale: Maintains simplicity while providing necessary technical depth
```

**This ensures that document updates reflect the complete conversation history and user learning journey, not just the most recent feedback.**

### Document Management During PR Review

**CRITICAL**: Never rename, move, or restructure documents during an active PR review process:

1. **No File Renaming**: Keep the same filename throughout the entire PR lifecycle
   - Renaming disrupts GitHub's revision history tracking
   - Makes it difficult to see line-by-line changes across iterations
   - Confuses the diff view and comment threading

2. **No File Moving**: Keep documents in the same directory during review
   - Moving files breaks PR comment links to specific lines
   - Disrupts the visual diff comparison
   - Makes it harder to track changes across review rounds

3. **No Major Restructuring**: Avoid large-scale section reordering during review
   - Keep section headers stable for consistent comment anchoring
   - Make content changes within existing structure
   - Save major restructuring for after PR merge

**Correct Approach**: Make all content updates within the existing file structure, then consider renaming/moving as a separate PR after the review is complete.

**Why This Matters**: PR reviews depend on stable file paths and names to maintain comment context and revision history clarity.
